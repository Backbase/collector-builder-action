# OpenTelemetry Collector Builder action

This action produces an OpenTelemetry Collector using the
manifest file configured.

NOTE: This action relies on having the file
available in the working directory. This means that if the
manifest file lives in a GitHub repository, the repository
will need to be checked out before this action is run.

## Inputs

## `manifest-file`

**Optional** The path of the manifest file. Refer to the OpenTelemetry Collector
Builder documentation regarding the format of the manifest. Defaults to `manifest.yaml`

## Outputs

## `collector-file`

The binary generated by the running the builder.

## Example usage

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - uses: codeboten/collector-builder-action@v1
  - with:
      manifest-file: "manifest.yaml"
```
